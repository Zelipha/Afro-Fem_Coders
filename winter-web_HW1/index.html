  <h1 class="underline">HTML basics</h1>
  <p>HTML (<span class="bold, underline">H</span>yper<span class="underline">T</span>ext </span> <span class="underline">M</span>arkup <span class="underline"></span>L</span>anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content
  could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title
  suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
  <h2>So what is HTML?</h2>
  <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you
  use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The
  enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags </p>
  <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>

  <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle
    brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
    <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name.
    This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the
    standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
    <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
    <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>HTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and content of a webpage, it says what content should be on a webpage. An HTML document is madeup of a series of elements. Some elements in this lesson are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Heading tags</li>
    <li>Paragraph</li>
    <li>List tags</li>
    <li>Image</li>
    <li>Hyper references</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is just a basic structure of html.</p>
